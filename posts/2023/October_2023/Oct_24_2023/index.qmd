After several weeks of accumulating issues with running command line and working in RStudio/Github (both locally and on Raven), I think I've finally resolved them all! I was able to run the tutorial blast code successfully (I think). I still want to figure out/ask about the function of all the parameters called (e.g. -evalue 1E-20), and to figure out how to interpret the output results (or at least learn how to identify possible issues in the output)
