## November Goals

Let's set some goals for the month of November (note, I'll be out on vacation for a few days this month over the Thanksgiving holiday)

-   Register, plan for, and present at GSS (will be on undergrad work, not Roberts lab stuff)

    ::: progress
    ::: {.progress-bar role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="100" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 100%"}

    Presented!

-   Cod project: Send samples out for RNA sequencing (don't need any sample prep, just find and send

## Reviewing October Goals

**âœ“ Successfully run a blast search in Raven.** Completed! I was able to run through Steven's full code for blasting and annotating a cod transcriptome, and I'll hopefully be able to glean enough from his code to understand how to write my own in the future.

**âœ— Read up on the cod temperature/growth project.** Not yet ðŸ˜•.

**âœ“ Read up on E5 coral project and start to get settled in it.** Getting there! I've started reading up on ncRNAs and, while I had to miss the last two meetings of the E5 group because of a midterm and a function required for one of my scholarships, I'll be meeting with the working group tomorrow morning.

**âœ“ Get registered for SICB.** Completed!
