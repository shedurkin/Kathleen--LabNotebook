Calculated necessary sample size for cod RNA sequencing, given an assumed coefficient of variation and detectable difference in expression -- view document [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-cod-temperature/blob/main/code/04-RNASeq-sample-size.md).

Met with the E5 molecular working group for the first time!
