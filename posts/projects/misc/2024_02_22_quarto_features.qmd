After looking through one of Sarah's posts I noticed she has some super cool features included in her Quarto digital lab notebook, so I'm doing a deep dive into the Quarto documentation!

### [Embedding source code](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#code-tools)

You can allow readers of a webpage to view all of the code used to create that html by including in the YAML:

``` default
format:
  html:
    code-tools:
      source: true
```

In the rendered HTML you'll see an "\</\> Code" icon next to the post title, and clicking this icon will show the page's source code!

(Since all of the code for this post should now be viewable directly from the HTML, I won't be inserting code chunks for any other sections to show what code to use for each feature. )

### [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

There are soooooo many cute icons to choose from (not really Quarto-specific, but you can use them in Quarto docs)

### [Tabsets](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#tabsets)

You can use tabsets to display sets of related information, separated by some features (e.g., programming language, treatment, species)

::: panel-tabset
## Python

``` python
def even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        result = "even"
    else:
        result = "odd"
    return result
```

## R

``` r
even_or_odd <- function(number) {
  if (number %% 2 == 0) {
    result <- "even"
  } else {
    result <- "odd"
  }
  return(result)
}
```
:::

You can also *group* tabsets by the tab names, so that when you switch tabs in one tabset, the other grouped tabsets will also switch to the same tab!

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Python

An ok programming language

## R

The far superior programming language

## Bash

Bane of my existence
:::

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## Python

A kind of snake

## R

The sound a pirate makes

## Bash

### [In-text annotation](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting)

You can enable in-text annotations in a post! Try highlighting a word -- the options "Annotate" and "Highlight" should pop up (though you'll need an account with [hypothesis.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to use this feature -- there are also options for instead using [Utteranc](https://utteranc.es/)es or [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) for in-text annotation))

### [Figures](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html)

There are a bunch of different ways to attach links and captions to text/images very easily, and to quickly generate sets of figures

### Videos

You can directly embed videos!
