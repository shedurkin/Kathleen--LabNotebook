I finished the code temp/growth analysis assigned by Steven, [code](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-cod-temperature/blob/main/code/01_temp-size-analysis/01_temp-size-analysis.Rmd) and [output pdf](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-cod-temperature/blob/main/code/01_temp-size-analysis/01_temp-size-analysis.pdf) can be found on lab github.

I aimed to identify whether temperature treatment affected cod growth, and analyzed data using two growth variables, size (mm) and weight (g) sampled three times between Nov.2022 and Feb.2023.

One-way ANOVA tests indicated statistically significant differences in both change in size (F(3, 156) = 37.9, p = 1.79e-18), and change in weight (F(3, 156) = 29.4, p = 3.73e-15) among the treatment temperatures. Additional application of Tukey's HSD test of multiple comparisons indicated that both mean size change and mean weight change were significantly different among all treatment temperatures *except* between the 9 and 16 degree treatments.
