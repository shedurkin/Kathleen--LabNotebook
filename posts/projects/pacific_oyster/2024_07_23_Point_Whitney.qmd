Shorter trip to Point Whitney today to bring my hardened dip/trip oysters back to FTR and grab a few things.

### Oysters

My hardened diploid/triploid oysters finished their 2 week recovery period yesterday, so today I brought them back to the lab for sampling and an extreme stress survivorship test. The oysters were packed in a cooler with ice, sandwiched between layers of wet paper/cardboard and foam, so that the oysters never came in direct contact with ice. They were packed like this for \~4 hours before I got them back to FTR and placed them in the right seawater tank in the FTR cold room. The tank contains seawater made from freshwater and Instant Sea, mixed to a salinity of \~27 psu, and held at 20C. These conditions were selected to match the ambient salinity and temperature the oysters experienced at Point Whitney for the last month. I also added roughly 15mL of Instant Algae once the oysters were placed in the tank, diluted before addition.

### Other PW tasks

I also took probe measurements from the dock and upweller we've been using (see picture below), and then packed both the probe and a new HOBO temperature logger to bring back to FTR. Added probe measurements to my ongoing [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EssYgZ8fZl4V9PLlYWtEGXSeln1L4JUM0bqT_MYv6cI/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
