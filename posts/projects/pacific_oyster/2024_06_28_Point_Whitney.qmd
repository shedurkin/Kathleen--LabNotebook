June 28, 2024, working at Point Whitney with A. Huffmeyer

[Github repo for the KD experiement](https://github.com/RobertsLab/oyster-ploidy-hardening)

Primary Goals for the day:

-   Adding cattle tags to KD experiment bags and the new seed bags

-   Performing hardening treatments on several cohorts

-   Weekly [probe measurements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EssYgZ8fZl4V9PLlYWtEGXSeln1L4JUM0bqT_MYv6cI/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

-   Maintenance on HUDLs and larvae (see [Ariana's post](https://ahuffmyer.github.io/ASH_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Point-Whitney-Field-Day-June-28-2024/) for more on this)

Cattle tags:

| 60            | Bag 2, triploid treatment | KD         |           |
| 64            | Bag 3, diploid control    | KD         |           |
| 65            | Bag 4, diploid treatment  | KD         |           |
