[miRanda](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754322001495#s0055)

Seems like a solid option, seen it cited in [coral miRNA paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754322001495#s0055), and listed in [review paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3927079/) @peterson_common_2014 as one of the OG, more regularly maintained miRNA target prediction programs that takes user sequence input. Most recently updated 2010. Also, available as downloadable software run on linux/unix, so more reproducible than the other main miRNA target prediction softwares which are web based. Only problem is that the miRanda site ([www.microrna.org](http://www.microrna.org/)) doesn't seem to be functional... This is extra weird because the coral miRNA paper that used it was from 2022, which is quite recent.\

Found a [site](https://regendbase.org/tools/miranda) that appears to use the miRanda algorithm in a web based tool, and it seems to be functioning normally

I tried emailing the corresponding authors of the miRanda papers, but I'm not confident I'll hear back. In the meantime I should also look into R package options, which weren't really covered in the 2014 review I've been referencing.

### [mirTarRnaSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mirTarRnaSeq.html)

R package. Actually requires miRanda to preprocess some input data :(

### [RNAhybrid](https://bio.tools/rnahybrid)

Webtool (though I think may have downloadable version?). At least the webtool limits input target file to 50,000 characters, which is a fraction of a full transcriptome. Could try doing DEG analysis first, but still might be too big...

### [TimiRGen](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TimiRGeN.html)

R package. There's no accessible vignette though, so would be a huge pain to figure out...
