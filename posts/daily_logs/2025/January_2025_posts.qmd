Weekly Overview:

| **TAing**       | 8.5    | 3.5     | 4.5       | 0.5      | 0.5     | **17.5**               |
| **Thesis work** | 0      | 3.5     | 2         | 3.5      | 2.5     | **11.5**               |

| **TOTALS**      | **10** | **9**   | **9.5**   | **11.5** | **9.5** | [**49.5**]{.underline} |

As a reminder, one of my monthly goals is to work a ***maximum*** **of 50hr/wk**, with a rough time allocation of: **20hr/wk** classes (SWED 101, FISH 513); **15hr/wk** TAing (QSCI 381); **15hr/wk** thesis work.

I've realized that I didn't account for the miscellaneous time commitments that come with being in grad school (e.g. seminar, emails, etc.), so I decided to start tracking that as well.\
\
This week looks good! I (barely) stayed within the 50 hr limit, I was able to keep TA hours under 20 hr/week and increase time devoted to thesis work. The miscellaneous time commitments were a little high this week because of the prospective grad student, Sydney, who visited the department and lab this week.

Weekly Overview:

|                 | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | TOTALS                   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Classes**     | 1      | 2       | 4         | 6        | 2      | **15**                   |
| **TAing**       | 8.5    | 7       | 3.5       | 1        | 2.5    | **22.5**                 |

As a reminder, one of my monthly goals is to work a ***maximum*** **of 50hr/wk**, with a rough time allocation of: **20hr/wk** classes (SWED 101, FISH 513); **15hr/wk** TAing (QSCI 381); **15hr/wk** thesis work.\
\
So far I'm happy with my progress! I worked a logged-total of **45.5 hrs** this week, spending **15hrs** on classes, **22.5hrs** on TAing, and **8hrs** on thesis stuff. The breakdown could definitely be adjusted. I expect to spend significantly less time on TAing after this first week, as students require less assistance for basic R tasks, and as the course site requires less setup/maintainance. I should spend more time on classes, particularly FISH315 research, and thesis work.
