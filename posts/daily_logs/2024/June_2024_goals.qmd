## Reviewing May Goals

✔️ Finalize committee selection and send out email requests

✔️ Pick which project(s) will comprise thesis proposal and discuss proposal with Steven

✔️ Finish GO annotation and functional enrichment analysis for cod, genome-based analysis

🟡 Read at least 10 papers to investigate the DEGs and functionally enriched processes from the cod data

🟡 Start a planning document for the oyster project in the same style as Ariana showed us during lab meeting (see [daily post](/posts/daily_logs/2024/February_2024_posts.qmd#february-2024-20)) (rollover-over)
