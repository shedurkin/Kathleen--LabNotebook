-   read/watched some stuff on using WGCNA (for E5 RNAseq and sRNAseq data)

-   Thought I was done w P. evermanni, but Sam pointed out that gff and bed files handle genomic coordinates differently and that, even though bedtools getfasta lists gffs as acceptable input formats, probably still treats them the same as bed files, so all of my transcriptome fastas could be off by 1-2 sequences. Probably doesn't affect end result of kallisto much, since it's pseudoaligning full reads, but still need to fix it. Should be a straightforward fix, the biggest pain will be waiting another 4 hours for the adjusted transcriptome generation code to run againðŸ˜­

-   Did a quick and dirty [test](/posts/projects/misc/2024_02_08_bedtools_gffvbed.qmd) using both a gff and a bed file as input to bedtools getfasta and both resulted in the same output, suggesting bedtools does appropriately differentiate between the formats! I'll still convert to bed before generating the P.evermanni transcriptome though, just in case

#### Tuesday

-   Wrote some checks for the P.evermanni transcriptome generation script, and I'm pretty confident now that it's running correctly. I did a final rerun of the generation and wrote a [notebook post](/posts/projects/E5_coral/2024_02_06_RNAseq_kallisto.qmd) for the kallisto process for all three deep dive species. Will need to update it tomorrow once I have the final P.evermanni transcriptome and can run it through kallisto as well.

-   510 class

#### Monday

-   Didn't allocate any time last week for the two class assignments I have due today, so cranking those out (proposal introduction for cod project, read and write up discussion for seminar papers)
-   Proposal writing class
-   Checked output for my P.evermanni genome fasta script, then generalized the script (i.e. changed input/output file assignments to use the bash variables I set at the beginning of the document) and reran. It ran much quicker this time around and resulted in a much smaller output file, which means one of the two times I ran the script something was wrong. I did some brief poking around in the two outputs and it looks like maybe the original run was accidentally done using the full gff file, instead of the CDS-only gff? I don't have time to resolve it tonight, but I'll check again tomorrow and run the code and output by someone (Zach, Steven)

## 02 February 2024

#### Friday

-   E5 molecular group meeting

-   Wrote a script to appropriately extract, group, and concatenate CDS fastas to build a genome fasta file for *P.evermanni* kallisto transcript abundance quantification (see details and some pseudocode [here](/posts/projects/E5_coral/2024_01_31_Peve_kallisto.qmd)). Script is pretty slow so I'll have to wait till Monday to get and check output file.

## 01 February 2024

#### Thursday

-   Lab meeting -- Ariana led a really great discussion about project planning and shared a *super* helpful sample [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Xw5QXnjyyJYEDEpGr4dzZ3VDq9JwmtPsxUFJBsVlW8/edit#gid=0) of how that might play out for a project, including timelines

-   Reviewed January goals, set February goals, and set up this month's daily log

-   added some pseudocode to the [Peve kallisto troubleshooting post](/posts/projects/E5_coral/2024_01_31_Peve_kallisto.qmd) and began implementing
