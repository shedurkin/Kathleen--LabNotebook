#### Monday

-   Didn't allocate any time last week for the two class assignments I have due today, so cranking those out (proposal introduction for cod project, read and write up discussion for seminar papers)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Proposal writing class

-   Checked output for my P.evermanni genome fasta script, then generalized the script (i.e. changed input/output file assignments to use the bash variables I set at the beginning of the document) and reran. It ran much quicker this time around and resulted in a much smaller output file, which means one of the two times I ran the script something was wrong. I did some brief poking around in the two outputs and it looks like maybe the original run was accidentally done using the full gff file, instead of the CDS-only gff? I don't have time to resolve it tonight, but I'll check again tomorrow and run the code and output by someone (Zach, Steven)

#### Friday

-   E5 molecular group meeting

-   Wrote a script to appropriately extract, group, and concatenate CDS fastas to build a genome fasta file for *P.evermanni* kallisto transcript abundance quantification (see details and some pseudocode [here](/posts/projects/E5_coral/2024_01_31_Peve_kallisto.qmd)). Script is pretty slow so I'll have to wait till Monday to get and check output file.

#### Thursday

-   Lab meeting -- Ariana led a really great discussion about project planning and shared a *super* helpful sample [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Xw5QXnjyyJYEDEpGr4dzZ3VDq9JwmtPsxUFJBsVlW8/edit#gid=0) of how that might play out for a project, including timelines

-   Reviewed January goals, set February goals, and set up this month's daily log

-   added some pseudocode to the [Peve kallisto troubleshooting post](/posts/projects/E5_coral/2024_01_31_Peve_kallisto.qmd) and began implementing
