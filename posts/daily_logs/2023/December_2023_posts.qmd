Hackathon 2023, Day Three!

-   Finished pulling and subsampling cod samples, and consolidated to send for RNAseq on Monday -- details [here](../../projects/pacific-cod/2021_12_14_pacific_cod.qmd)
-   Common recommendation for citation managers during lab meeting was [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) (for collaboration and easy integration with the Google environment) *with* a supplementary manager like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (for easier indexing, more detailed metadata, working offline). This sounds like a good plan to me! Messaged Steven about getting access to the lab paid Paperpile, and downloaded Zotero to start adding all my current lab-relevant literature.
-   Started the tedious process of adding all of the papers I have downloaded to my laptop and iPad to Zotero, and transferring my highlighting/notes for each

Hackathon 2023, Day Two!

-   Finished overhauling my lab notebook site (for now). I reformatted the home page and added a site section for each of the projects I'm working on. For each project, have "about" page and posts for all the work I'm doing in that project (instead of having everything in just my daily logs). Still want to do something about all of the lit review notes/questions I currently have cluttering up my daily logs, but haven't 100% decided how I want to do that yet...

-   [Compiled spreadsheets](../../projects/pacific_cod/2023_12_13_pacific_cod.qmd) detailing the samples we plan on sending out for RNAseq and methylation

Hackathon 2023, Day One!

-   Backed up all E5 deep-dive work to-date on Gannet

-   Added sRNA investigation results for *P.meandrina* to the "E5 - Descriptive ncRNAs in corals" doc, including links to associated data/outputs

-   Met with Steven to go over some long-term project plans and outlined a (very preliminary) timeline of degree progess

-   Started overhauling my lab notebook site, will finish tomorrow

## 11 December 2023

#### Monday

With the end of the quarter and no more classwork, today's the day for lots of little things!

-   Updated calendars (mine and lab) for the next few weeks and next quarter

-   Moved all code/data from Autumn 2023 classes to github repo for future reference, and saved local copies of relevant class materials before end of quarter.

-   Still no access to TREQ system, so emailed around again about that

-   Registered for UW eScience Institute Software Carpentry Workshop in January -- Python focused!

-   Brainstormed some stuff to talk about w/ Steven related to long-term plans for my degree work

## 08 December 2023

#### Friday

Took QSCI482 midterm (last assignment of the quarter!) and read some papers.

## 07 December 2023

#### Thursday

Lab meeting! Started [sampling cod liver tissue samples]() for RNAseq.

## 06 December 2023

#### Wednesday

-   Studied and took practice midterm for QSCI 482 (test on Friday) -- got a 95!

-   Read Chpt.2 for DEI -focused lab meeting tomorrow

## 05 December 2023

#### Tuesday

Office setup supplies arrived and I unpackaged and setup my new monitor, laptop stand, keyboard, and mouse! Still need to find some batteries for the wireless keyboard though.

Finished *P.meandrina* sRNA work, and compiled comparison of approaches across the three species ([here](../../projects/E5_coral/2023_12_05_E5_coral.qmd)).
