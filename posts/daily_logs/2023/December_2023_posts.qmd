Hackathon 2023, Day One!

-   Backed up all E5 deep-dive work to-date on Gannet

-   Added sRNA investigation results for *P.meandrina* to the "E5 - Descriptive ncRNAs in corals" doc, including links to associated data/outputs

-   Met with Steven to go over some long-term project plans and outlined a (very preliminary) timeline of degree progess

-   Started overhauling my lab notebook site, will finish tomorrow

## 11 December 2023

#### Monday

With the end of the quarter and no more classwork, today's the day for lots of little things!

-   Updated calendars (mine and lab) for the next few weeks and next quarter

-   Moved all code/data from Autumn 2023 classes to github repo for future reference, and saved local copies of relevant class materials before end of quarter.

-   Still no access to TREQ system, so emailed around again about that

-   Registered for UW eScience Institute Software Carpentry Workshop in January -- Python focused!

-   Brainstormed some stuff to talk about w/ Steven related to long-term plans for my degree work

## 08 December 2023

#### Friday

Took QSCI482 midterm (last assignment of the quarter!) and read some papers.

## 07 December 2023

#### Thursday

Lab meeting! Started sampling cod liver tissue samples for RNAseq (excluded samples with intestinal tapeworms) -- bolding indicates sampled this morning (\~30mg), and then stored at -80\*C.

## 06 December 2023

#### Wednesday

-   Studied and took practice midterm for QSCI 482 (test on Friday) -- got a 95!

-   Read Chpt.2 for DEI -focused lab meeting tomorrow

Office setup supplies arrived and I unpackaged and setup my new monitor, laptop stand, keyboard, and mouse! Still need to find some batteries for the wireless keyboard though.

The [*P.meandrina* miRdeep2](https://github.com/urol-e5/deep-dive/blob/main/F-Pmea/code/11-Pmea-sRNAseq-miRdeep2.md) finished running!

A quick comparison of the different miRNA ID approaches for the three species we've been looking at:
