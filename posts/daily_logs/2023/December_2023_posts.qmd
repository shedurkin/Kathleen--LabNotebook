Hackathon 2023, Day One!

-   Backed up all E5 deep-dive work to-date on Gannet

-   Added sRNA investigation results for *P.meandrina* to the "E5 - Descriptive ncRNAs in corals" doc, including links to associated data/outputs

-   Met with Steven to go over some long-term project plans and outlined a (very preliminary) timeline of degree progess

-   Started overhauling my lab notebook site, will finish tomorrow

## 11 December 2023

#### Monday

With the end of the quarter and no more classwork, today's the day for lots of little things!

-   Updated calendars (mine and lab) for the next few weeks and next quarter

-   Moved all code/data from Autumn 2023 classes to github repo for future reference, and saved local copies of relevant class materials before end of quarter.

-   Still no access to TREQ system, so emailed around again about that

-   Registered for UW eScience Institute Software Carpentry Workshop in January -- Python focused!

-   Brainstormed some stuff to talk about w/ Steven related to long-term plans for my degree work

Lab meeting! Started [sampling cod liver tissue samples]() for RNAseq. (excluded samples with intestinal tapeworms) -- bolding indicates sampled this morning (\~30mg), and then stored at -80\*C.

Office setup supplies arrived and I unpackaged and setup my new monitor, laptop stand, keyboard, and mouse! Still need to find some batteries for the wireless keyboard though.

Finished *P.meandrina* sRNA work, and compiled comparison of approaches across the three species ([here](../../projects/E5_coral/2023_12_05_E5_coral.qmd)).
