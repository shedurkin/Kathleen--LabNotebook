The oysters were packed in a cooler with ice, sandwiched between layers of wet paper/cardboard and foam, so that the oysters never came in direct contact with ice. They were packed like this for \\~4 hours before I got them back to FTR and placed them in the right seawater tank in the FTR cold room. The tank contains seawater made from freshwater and Instant Sea, mixed to a salinity of \\~27 psu, and held at 20C. These conditions were selected to match the ambient salinity and temperature the oysters experienced at Point Whitney for the last month. I also added roughly 15mL of Instant Algae once the oysters were placed in the tank, diluted before addition.\n\n### Other PW tasks\n\nI also took probe measurements from the dock and upweller we've been using (see picture below), and then packed both the probe and a new HOBO temperature logger to bring back to FTR. Added probe measurements to my ongoing [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EssYgZ8fZl4V9PLlYWtEGXSeln1L4JUM0bqT_MYv6cI/edit?gid=0#gid=0).\n\n![](images/IMG_9391.jpg){width=\"700\"}\n\n### Ucar/ferry \n\nSubmitted ferry receipts for reimbursement 7/24\n\n![](images/IMG_9405.jpg){width=\"500\"}\n",
