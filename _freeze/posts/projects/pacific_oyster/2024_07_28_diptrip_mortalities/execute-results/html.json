They've now had a few days to acclimate to the tank, so I checked post-hardening mortality, making note of size as well.\n\nTo check a bag I emptied it onto a counter and sorted by live/dead. Evaluated whether alive or dead by squeezing lightly on hinge and, for any oysters that gaped, prodding lightly with metal tool. Lack of response indicated death. I took a picture of all oysters, separated by live or dead, with a ruler, then measured the length of each manually with a caliper. Removed and discarded dead oysters/shells.\n\n[Mortality and size data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvq3cIyN-kI8eTnX96CSJhre9aA-Rj9POYtFrEdOtac/edit?gid=61126976#gid=61126976)\n\nPictures below -- oysters lying above the caliper are dead, below are live\n\n![Bag 045 -- 81/100 surviving (\\~20% mortality)](images/Bag045.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\n![Bag 060 -- 65/100 surviving (\\~35% mortality)](images/Bag060.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\n![Bag 064 -- 61/100 surviving (\\~40% mortality)](images/Bag064.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\n![Bag 065 -- 68/100 surviving (\\~30% mortality)](images/Bag065.jpg){width=\"400\"}\n\nDuring sampling I want to sample a roughly even size distribution from each group. To standardize, I set four size classes based on the average lower quartile, median, and upper quartiles of surviving oysters in each group.\n\n|                         | Bag 045 | Bag 060 | Bag 064 | Bag 065 | Average |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| **lower quartile (mm)** | 32      | 31      | 38      | 39.75   | 35.2    |\n| **median (mm)**         | 39      | 36      | 45      | 47      | 41.8    |\n| **upper quartile (mm)** | 45      | 44      | 56      | 51.25   | 49.1    |\n\nSize classes:\n\nRound to nearest mm\n\n| Size class | length range |\n|------------|--------------|\n| 1          | 0mm - 35mm   |\n| 2          | 36mm - 42mm  |\n| 3          | 43mm - 49mm  |\n| 4          | 50mm -       |\n",
