I would guess it's the former, but I couldn't say for sure.\n\nI also only had time to do the Poly IC immune hardening for 1 hr today, instead of the usual 2.\n\nI took probe measurements from the upweller holding the KD oysters, the upweller holding the broodstock, the dock, and from each of the stress treatment containers.
