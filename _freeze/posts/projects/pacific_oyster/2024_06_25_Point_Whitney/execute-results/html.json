I then measured the length of each with calipers and separated into four treatment bags of 100 oysters each (2 bags of triploids, 2 bags of diploids). Oysters were not individually labelled/tagged. See photos of the datasheets below and [digital spreadsheets here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zvq3cIyN-kI8eTnX96CSJhre9aA-Rj9POYtFrEdOtac/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n[Observations:]{.underline}\n\nThe diploids were generally a bit bigger, there were more oysters larger than the desired size range (20mm - 60mm), and there were more dead oysters. There were also several instances in both groups of two oysters fused together, and these were excluded from the oysters compiled for the experiment.6\n\n[Length summary stats (mm):]{.underline}\n\n|                    |                 |         |         |           |          |            |\n|--------------------|-----------------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|\n| **Bag**            | **Sample size** | **Min** | **Max** | **Range** | **Mean** | **Median** |\n| triploid control   | 100             | 23      | 65      | 42        | 35.62    | 34         |\n| triploid treatment | 100             | 23      | 54      | 31        | 32.47    | 30         |\n| diploid control    | 100             | 18      | 60      | 42        | 37.42    | 36         |\n| diploid treatment  | 100             | 21      | 65      | 44        | 39.77    | 38         |\n\n![](images/datasheet1_2024_06_25.JPG)\n\n![](images/datasheet2_2024_06_25.JPG)\n\n![](images/datasheet3_2024_06_25.JPG)\n\nBags are green mesh, and were labelled with a number (Bag 1, Bag 2, Bag 3, Bag 4), ploidy (triploid or diploid), and treatment group (control or treatment), as well as the identifier \"UW-KD, Roberts\" to distinguish our bags from others in the hatchery. For each bag, one tag was placed inside the bag and an identical tag was attached to the exterior with a zip tie.\n\n|       |          |           |\n|-------|----------|-----------|\n| Bag 1 | triploid | control   |\n| Bag 2 | triploid | treatment |\n| Bag 3 | diploid  | control   |\n| Bag 4 | diploid  | treatment |\n\n![sample bag tag](images/tag_bag1.JPG)\n\n### Stress hardening plan\n\nOysters are being held at \"ambient\" in outdoor tank at the Point Whitney Shellfish Laboratory, with water temperature held at 22C.\n\nThe stress hardening regime will involve placing the treatment oysters (100 triploid and 100 diploid) in a heated tank for four hour sessions, three times a week, for two weeks. After a hardening session they will be placed back in the ambient tanks.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" icon=\"false\"}\n[Temperature]{.underline}: 35C\n\n[Time]{.underline}: 4 hours per session\n\n[Frequency]{.underline}: 3 times/week for two weeks. Choosing to do hardening sessions on Monday, Wednesday, Friday for convenience.\n:::\n\n-   First hardening session on Wednesday, 06/26/2024, performed by Steven.\n\n-   Second hardening session on Friday, 06/28/2024, will be performed by Ariana.\n\n-   I think the rest (Mon 07/01/2024, Wed 07/03/2024, Fri 07/05/2024, Mon 07/08/2024) will be done by me.\n\n### UCar rental/mileage details\n\nQuick overview of Ucar rental and ferry reciepts. I also want to get an estimate of my transport costs for one day at the hatchery.\n\n![UCar checkout](images/ucar_checkout.JPG)\n\n![UCar dash at check in](images/ucar_checkin.JPG)\n\n![ferry receipt out](images/ferry_reciept_1.jpeg)\n\n![ferry receipt back](images/ferry_reciept_2.jpeg)\n\n|                                    |              |\n|------------------------------------|-------------:|\n| UCar max daily rate (5+ hrs):      |      \\$34.45 |\n| Mileage (110 miles x \\$0.34/mile): |      \\$37.40 |\n| Ferries (out and back):            |      \\$44.50 |\n| Total cost:                        | **\\$116.35** |\n\n**Would it be cheaper to drive all the way around, to avoid ferry costs?**\n\nRoundtrip mileage if I take the ferry route: 120 miles (\\~4 hours)\\\nRoundtrip mileage if I take the long way around: 240 miles (\\~5 hours)\\\nMileage difference: 120 miles = \\$40.80\n\nSo driving the long, ferry-free route would have essentially the same additional mileage cost as the ferry fees. In other words, **it would cost the same**. Since The ferry route saves some time and involves less driving, I'm going to stick with it.\n",
