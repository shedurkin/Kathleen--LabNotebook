In humans, this has been identified as a potential mechanism of carcinogenisis! (Reviewed in Karimzadeh et al. (2021))\n\n## **Which genes are involved in DNA methylation?**\n\n\"DNA methylation machinery is composed of several enzymes to accurately regulate the gene expression together. The main enzyme-encoding genes comprise a small family of DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase, which are involved in established (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and DNA methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B)) and maintenance (DNMT1) of methylation patterns. The other genes are methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MBPs; methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD)1--4, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), UHRF1/2, ZBTB33, ZBTB4, and ZBTB38) that assist in expression repression and 10--11 translocation (TET) enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3); seemingly, are implicated in DNA demethylation10,11. Some experiments demonstrated that, based on the importance of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes alterations in the development of each type of cancer, DNA methylation regulator genes may enhance or suppress cancer development in each specific type of cancer12,13,14,15,16.\" Karimzadeh et al. (2021)\n\nSo we're looking for miRNAs that target genes encoding: - DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) - methyl-CpG-binding proteins - 10--11 translocation (TET) enzymes\n\nFirst let's see what a quick search of our annotated A.pulchra genome turns up. I want to find any annotations related to DNA methyltransferase\n\n```         \n awk -F'\\t' '$5 ~ /methyltransferase/ {print $2, $5}' OFS='\\t' \\ ../output/02-Apul-reference-annotation/Apulcra-genome-mRNA-IDmapping-2024_12_12.tab \\ | grep \"DNA\"\n```\n\n```         \n## \"ntLink_8:23126215-23133100\" \"DNA methyltransferase 1-associated protein 1 (DNMAP1) (DNMT1-associated protein 1)\" ## \"ptg000001l:8684194-8690468\" \"Alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 8 (Probable alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ABH8) (S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent tRNA methyltransferase ABH8) (tRNA (carboxymethyluridine(34)-5-O)-methyltransferase ABH8) (EC 2.1.1.-, EC 2.1.1.229)\" ## \"ptg000001l:8684194-8690468\" \"Alkylated DNA repair protein alkB homolog 8 (Probable alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ABH8) (S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent tRNA methyltransferase ABH8) (tRNA (carboxymethyluridine(34)-5-O)-methyltransferase ABH8) (EC 2.1.1.-, EC 2.1.1.229)\" ## \"ptg000023l:4341384-4351489\" \"N(6)-adenine-specific methyltransferase METTL4 (Methyltransferase-like protein 4) (N(6)-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase METTL4) (EC 2.1.1.72) (snRNA (2'-O-methyladenosine-N(6)-)-methyltransferase METTL4) (EC 2.1.1.-)\" ## \"ptg000023l:30502755-30503307\"   \"Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.63) (6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) (MGMT) (O-6-methylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase)\" ## \"ptg000047l:7043865-7069644\" \"DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) (EC 2.1.1.37) (DNA methyltransferase GgaI) (DNA MTase GgaI) (M.GgaI) (MCMT)\" ## \"ptg000047l:7043865-7069644\" \"DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) (EC 2.1.1.37) (DNA methyltransferase GgaI) (DNA MTase GgaI) (M.GgaI) (MCMT)\" ## \"ptg000047l:7043865-7069644\" \"DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) (EC 2.1.1.37) (DNA methyltransferase GgaI) (DNA MTase GgaI) (M.GgaI) (MCMT)\"\n```\n\nThere's definitely DNMT machinery genes anontated in our A.pulchra genome (as expected)! Now let's create a data frame that associated each annotated mRNA with it's gene ID (i.e.Â FUN######) and do a more broad search for different machinery involved in methylation\n\n```         \n# Read in data mRNA_annot <- read.table(\"../output/02-Apul-reference-annotation/Apulcra-genome-mRNA-IDmapping-2024_12_12.tab\", header=TRUE, sep='\\t') %>% select(-X) mRNA_geneIDs <- read.table(\"../output/15-Apul-annotate-UTRs/Apul-mRNA-FUNids.txt\", header=FALSE, sep='\\t')  # Join mRNA_annot_geneID <- left_join(mRNA_annot, mRNA_geneIDs, by=\"V1\") mRNA_annot_geneID$V4 <- gsub(\"Parent=\", \"\", mRNA_annot_geneID$V4)  # To double-check that this worked correctly, check for NAs in the column containing gene IDs # Every mRNA has a gene ID, so this should return FALSE any(is.na(mRNA_annot_geneID$V3.y))\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] FALSE\n```\n\nNow let's select genes that encode different protein machinery relevant to DNA methylation\n\n```         \nmethyl_machinery <- subset(mRNA_annot_geneID,                             (grepl(\"methyltransferase\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                              & grepl(\"DNA\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names))                            | grepl(\"DNMT\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"Dnmt\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"MBP\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"MBD\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"MECP\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"UHRF\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"ZBTB\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            | grepl(\"TET\", mRNA_annot_geneID$Protein.names)                            )  nrow(methyl_machinery)\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] 23\n```\n\nWe find 23 mRNAs in our A.pulchra genome that encode known DNA methylation machinery!\n\nNote that I stipulated the term \"methyltransferase\" must be accompanied by \"DNA\" also present in the Protein.names column. I imposed this restriction because, when I searched for \"methyltransferase\" alone, methyltransferases related to histone modification and modification with nucleotides other than cytosine came up.\n\nNow let's see whether any of these methylation machinery genes are putative miRNA targets, using the output from our target-prediction software, miRanda.\n\n```         \nmiranda_apul <- read.table(\"../output/18-Apul-interactions-functional-annotation/miRanda_miRNA_mRNA.txt\", header=TRUE, sep='\\t')  miranda_methyl_machinery <- left_join(methyl_machinery, miranda_apul, by=c(\"V4\" = \"mRNA_FUNid\"))  length(na.omit(miranda_apul$miRNA_cluster))\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] 6109\n```\n\n```         \nlength(unique(na.omit(miranda_apul$miRNA_cluster)))\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] 39\n```\n\n```         \nlength(na.omit(miranda_methyl_machinery$miRNA_cluster))\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] 0\n```\n\n```         \nlength(unique(na.omit(miranda_methyl_machinery$miRNA_cluster)))\n```\n\n```         \n## [1] 0\n```\n\nMiranda originally identified 6109 putative targets of 39 of our miRNAs, but none of these targets are included in our list of DNA methylation machinery mRNA. :(\n\nSo this means that our **A.pulchra miRNAs do not putatively bind to any methylation machinery mRNA** and/or I'm missing some genes in my search.\n\nKarimzadeh, Mohammad Reza, Peyman Pourdavoud, Naeim Ehtesham, Mohaddese Qadbeigi, Masood Movahedi Asl, Behrang Alani, Meysam Mosallaei, and Bahram Pakzad. 2021. \"Regulation of DNA Methylation Machinery by Epi-miRNAs in Human Cancer: Emerging New Targets in Cancer Therapy.\" *Cancer Gene Therapy* 28 (3): 157--74. <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41417-020-00210-7>.\n",
