Most recently updated 2010. Also, available as downloadable software run on linux/unix, so more reproducible than the other main miRNA target prediction softwares which are web based. Only problem is that the miRanda site ([www.microrna.org](http://www.microrna.org/)) doesn't seem to be functional... This is extra weird because the coral miRNA paper that used it was from 2022, which is quite recent.\\\n\\\n[miRanda tutorial](https://bioinformaticsworkbook.org/dataAnalysis/SmallRNA/Miranda_miRNA_Target_Prediction.html#gsc.tab=0)\n\nFound a [site](https://regendbase.org/tools/miranda) that appears to use the miRanda algorithm in a web based tool, and it seems to be functioning normally\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202024-07-19%20165134.png)\n\n![](images/Screenshot%202024-07-19%20165241.png)\n\nI tried emailing the corresponding authors of the miRanda papers, but I'm not confident I'll hear back. In the meantime I should also look into R package options, which weren't really covered in the 2014 review I've been referencing.\n\n### [mirTarRnaSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mirTarRnaSeq.html)\n",
