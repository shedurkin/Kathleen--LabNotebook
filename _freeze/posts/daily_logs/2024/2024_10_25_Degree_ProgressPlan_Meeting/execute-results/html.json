Discussing with Kerry on Tuesday (10/29), I think (hope) she'll agree to join my committee! If not, Jackie would also fit.\n\n-   Have first committee meeting. **What materials/slides do I need to prepare for this?**\n\n    -   Need to prepare material overviewing my current degree progress and plans for completion\n\n-   Submit Plan of Study. Currently need 5.5 credits to complete masters requirements (4.5 if CENV 590 can by counted toward degree -- would need approval). **What other courses would be beneficial for proposed study?**\n\n-   Thesis focus: role of multiple epigenetic mechanisms and their interactions in environmental memory/stress response in marine invertebrates.\n\n    -   E5: miRNA, miRNA + RNA expression, miRNA/siRNA + DNA methylation\n\n-   Q: **How is collaborative work handled for thesis? E.g., to what extent can E5 work be included in thesis?**\n\n    -   E5 work that I've completed is fully eligible\n\n### Thesis progress and brainstorming\n\nChapter 1: corals deep-dive (+ deep-dive-expression)\n\nI've currently completed miRNA/siRNA characterization and preliminary expression work. I'm in the process of characterizting patterns of sncRNA + mRNA coexpression. Will also incorporate DNA methylation mapping and sncRNA/methylation interaction analysis.\n\n-   were methylation samples sent out? for deep dive\n\n-   could also include coral hDNA methylation in this if I receive the SIFP\n\n-   logical expansion into PhD thesis is looking at time series data\n\nChapter 2: environmental memory in oysters\n\n-   we have data for oysters under OA exposure. Described in parents, but not yet touched children. In parents have gene expression and methylation (plus lncRNA from the RNAseq data)\n\n-   so I could look into **heritability of methylation in oysters**\n\n-   methylation data from the offspring already exists!! (i.e., the samples have already been sequenced)\n\n-   side note: lab has already looked into barcoding bisulfite-converted DNA, but had limited success because their gene of interest was very long and bisulfite treatment degrades high-molecular-weight DNA. It would be interesting to develop some kind of screening protocol to screen for methylation patterns associate with resilience. (e.g., for broodstock screening)\n\n### To-Do: \n\nE5:\n\n-   For each miRNA, calculate correlation coefficent with each gene\n\n-   Look into miRNA binding again (get software from Jill?)\n\n-   interactions with lncRNA (get data from Zach). Could also do binding here, since lncRNAs may be sponges, precursors, etc.\n\n-   cross-species stuff could be interesting -- gene orthologs? but can be back burner for now\n\n-   correlation between methylation in an miRNA-coding region and expression of that miRNA.\n\nGeneral:\n\n-   can bring Hollie in now for committee\n\n-   schedule meeting with steven, weekly thursdays at 11\n\n## WI25\n\n-   Full draft of Masters Proposal\n\n-   Q: **To what extant can your thesis work deviate from submitted Proposal?**\n\n## SP25/SU25\n\n-   Submit finalized Masters Proposal\n\n## SU25\n\n-   Possibly Smithsonian fellowship (coral hDNA methylation), 10wks\n\n    -   **How would funding for the remaining \\~4wks work for this?**\n\n## AU25\n\n-   MS exam + bypass\n",
