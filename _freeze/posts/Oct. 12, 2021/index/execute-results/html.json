Included the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(bash='C:/Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe'))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd now, while I still don't seem to get any output when I try to run individual code chunks by pressing the \"play\" button in the top right corner, knitting the document works! I still haven't figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files, so for now I guess I'll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I'm working in.\n",
