I’m still in the early stages of my projects, so it’s difficult to know exactly which papers might be useful for future project planning, lit reviews, writing, etc. I recently started using a new method to organize all of my papers, so I thought I’d share!\n\nStep 1: Zotero\nI started using the reference manager Zotero in December and I really like being able to annotate papers, generate notes, and assign tags. My workflow when I find a new paper I’m interested in is to first read the abstract, add the paper to my Zotero library, and assign tags related to how I might plan on using the paper (e.g. species name, relevant methods) . I also always assign the tag “unread,” and then change it to “read” once I’ve finished reading/annotating.\nHowever, Zotero doesn’t have an easy way to view the tags, notes, or some types of metadata associated with multiple papers at the same time. Since I’m a very visual person, I want a way to view, sort, and search the key information from all of my papers at the same time. After asking for suggestions in the lab Slack, Chris sent me a Sheets template that I’ve been testing out!\n\n\nStep 2: Google Sheets\nOriginal template (from Chris)\nMy current document\nMy current setup for this document looks like this:\n\n\nThe metadata recorded in the Sheets document is a little redundant because all of my papers are already stored in my Zotero library, but it ensures I’m recording information for the right paper.\nHere’s a look at all of the options for the different categorical variables:\n\n\nWith these options I can search by project, study type, and relevance, and keep track of how thoroughly I’ve read a source in my library.\nI’m still in the early stages of implementing this document, but so far I really like it! While I was brainstorming the oyster project experimental design I had to reference a few papers and the Sheets document made it much easier to quickly go through many papers and the information I’d identified as most helpful, without having to individually click on each paper to view its associated metadata/notes. I still need to transfer everything i currently have in my Zotero library to the Sheets doc, but I think having this system in place before I really get into the weeds of reading dozens/hundreds of papers for thesis writing will be super helpful!"

Study something similar in oysters (if their life history makes sense)? Interesting to think about possible epigenetic mismatch of gametes…\nstudy set of multiple stressors and/or multiple generations on methylation/expression/phenotype/etc. (e.g. Feiner et al. 2022, set of chemical and thermal environmental stressors on daphnia to investigate epigenetic heritability)\nIn same daphnia paper (Feiner er al. 2022), saw responses to naturally occurring stressors were more inherited than those to non-naturally occurring ones — possible suggestion of underlying preadaptation towards certain epigenetic modifications that helps allow them to be passed on successfully and retained?\nkeep in mind MHW conditions (sudden dramatic swings), not just slow warming creep of climate crisis\nIf epigeneitc modification is heritable, what are epigenetic impacts of releasing captive/bred stock back into wild?\nIs it possible to study gene expression/methylation/ncRNA in ancient DNA?

    "text": "Questions\n\nNeed to look more into epigenetic reprogramming – how does it work, mechanistically? How does it differ among taxa, especially between model organisms and inverts? How would it differ among sexual reproduction and the many forms of asexual reproduction?\nHeritability of ncRNA-related epigenetic changes?\nWhile reading George et al. 2023, I noticed they used heat shock to induce triploidy in their Pacific oysters (referenced Yamamoto et al. 1988, which showed you can apply a heat shock of 35*C to 20*C-acclimated larvae during meiosis to induce triploidy). Raised the question of whether this can/does happen in the wild? And if it’s possible to achieve triploidy-inducing heat shock conditions in the wild, does that mean that climate change/increased incidence of MHW will begin shifting wild oyster populations to more triploids, and thus affect fertility/reproductive viability of wild pops?\nA common way of producing triploid oyster stocks nowadays is crossing tetraploid and diploid oysters (genertes 100% triploid offspring without the mortality associated with heat-shock or chemically induced triploidy). We know that induced-triploids are less robust to temperature/aerial exposure stress than diploids (George et al. 2023). Is it possible that, in induced triploids, the heat/chemical shock at an early life stage epigenetically “primes” them poorly? Epigenetic modifications and genetic adaptations to stress are heritable, though, so how do tetraploidXdiploid triploids fare under stress conditions, and can this be modulated by the acclimation/adaptation of the parents?\nDuring some preliminary lit review on Pacific cod and MHW related mortality, I read that overall warming and early-year MHWs can affect the timing of marine primary production (e.g. phytoplankton reproduction and abundance). Oysters feed on phytoplankton through filter feeding – does that mean that, as oceans warm, oysters may be facing more starvation stress? Especially if there ends up being a “mismatch” of spawning and primary production?\nDoes polyploidy affect the way you analyze and compare gene expression data? Since a triploid would have an extra set of chromosomes, could that affect number of transcripts even if [# transcripts expressed per chromosome] didnt change?"

There was, however, a significant effect on the symbiont populations – in presence of estrogen, symbionts were increasingly photosynthetically efficient – woah!

Apparently there’s a kind of plant that grows in/near salty water and, to rid itself of excess salt, basically picks a leaf to die and sends all the salt there, leaving the rest of the plant healthy. Maybe similar stuff happens in corals?"

    "text": "SICB Day 5\nThe importance of life history strategies in the recovery of corals after thermal stress (Jacqueline Padilla-Gamino)\n\nSuper interesting idea! Basically, maybe the combination of MHW and differing egg/sperm developmental timelines are causing egg/sperm mismatch when spawning happens!\nEggs take a long time to develop and start in late summer, and thus are already in development during MHW/bleaching events. Sperm, however, as “cheap” and don’t start developing until March, so never experience bleaching before the spawning season in early summer. That means that, during spawning, you can end up with bleaching-affected eggs trying to match with unstressed sperm – maybe that “mismatch” is causing problems!\nBred bleached (B) and non-bleached (NB) corals. Found that BxB corals and NBxNB corals were most successful in larval development, while BxNB and NBxB corals didn’t do as well. Support for this possible mismatch problem\nWhile I’m sure this is at least partially because of bleaching-related stress effects of the viability of the eggs or something similar, this is making me think about the possible role of epigenetics here. We know that environmental conditions can be associated with epigenetic modifications like methylation, and that such epigenetic modifications can also take place in the gametes and thus become heritable. Is it possible that there are epigenetic modifications happening in the eggs during these bleaching events that are not happening to the sperm, and that this “mismatch” of the epigenome is less successful that the combination of two stress-modified gametes (BxB) or of two non-modified gametes (NBxNB)?\n\nAssessing physiological and molecular plasticity in the early stages of Porites astreoides (Florence Fields)\nIntraspecific variation in thermal tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora palmata (Holland Elder)\n\nKeep in mind bleaching, like other stress reponses, is continuous, not binary!\n\nThe butterfly(fish) effect: Using Caetodontidae territories as bioindicators (Corrine Avidan)\nMicrobial predictors of bleacing in Great Barrier Reef Acropora millepora (Karim Primov)\nIron wars over ligand soup: Exploring chemical crosstalk in Symbiodiniaceae-bacteria interactions (Hannah Reich)\n\nBacteria can help eukaryotic partners (like algae) access hard-to-get iron\nPossible connection here to Callum’s talk about impacts of heavy metal contamination on coral/holobiont?\n\nEnvironmental drivers of coral-associated algal and microbial communities across multiple scales (Coleen Bove)"

    "text": "In the process of running kallisto on the three E5 deep dive species, we realized that there’s no transcriptome FASTA available for P. evermanni. That means we need to generate one!\nRendered code\nRelated posts:\nRNAseq abundance quantification (A.Pulchra, P.evermanni, P.meandrina)\nP.evermanni RNAseq kallisto debugging\nTesting bedtools: gff vs bed input file\n\nStarter files\nThe closest file to a P. evermanni transcriptome that we have is a P.evermanni coding sequence (CDS) gff file, and a corresponding genome scaffolds FASTA.\nhead of gff:\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove mRNA 3107 4488 543 - .

Parent=Peve_00000001\nA gff file lists information that can be used to identify and retrieve specific sequences. The first column lists the region or scaffold of a reference genome in which the sequence can be found; the third identifies which genomic feature (e.g., mRNA, CDS, UTR) the sequence is; and the fourth and fifth are genomic coordinates for the beginning and end of the sequence. Since we have both the coding sequences gff and a reference fasta, we should be able to extract FASTA sequences for all of the relevant sequences in the gff!\n\n\nExtract CDS sequences\nFirst, it looks like the gff has features labelled a little weirdly. Normally we’d want all of the mRNA sequences, but it looks like this file lists mRNA sequences that include introns. Instead, we want all of the CDS sequences associated with each mRNA (association is denoted in the final column with a parent mRNA ID, e.g. “Parent=Peve_00000001”). That means the first step is to extract all of the CDS sequences from our gff file.\n\n# Extract only the CDS sequence lines from the gff\ngrep -w 'CDS' ${transcriptome_gff} &gt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nhead -n 5 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nConvert gff to bed\nThen we convert this filtered CDS gff file to a bed file, which has slightly different formatting. We’re doing this because we’ll be using a tool called bedtools getfasta, which can take both gff and bed files, but which I trust more to appropriately parse bed files (though, see post on whether it can handle gff files correctly as well).\n\n# Ensure bedops can find its dependencies when running\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed \\\n--do-not-sort \\\n&lt; ${transcriptome_gff_filtered} \\\n&gt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_gff_filtered}\necho \"\"\nhead -n 3 ${transcriptome_bed}\n\nPorites_evermani_scaffold_1 Gmove   CDS 3107    3444    .   -   .

Parent=Peve_00000002\n\n\nGenerating a transcriptome FASTA\nThe basic approach to generating this transcriptome makes use of the fact that each CDS sequence in our bed file is assigned a “parent” mRNA, denoted by a parent Id in the last column (e.g., “Parent=Peve_00000001”). Each sequence with the same parent ID should be used to a) retrieve a FASTA for that sequence, and b) concatenate all of the FASTAs with the same parent ID into a single, labelled gene FASTA. The below code will iterate through our entire bed file and do this for each parent ID and its associated sequences.\n\n# Load bash variables into memory\nsource .bashvars\n\n# Navigate to correct directory and make output file\ncd ${transcriptome_dir}\necho &gt; ${transcriptome_fasta_name}\n\n# Helper list for processing all parent IDs\nprocessed_ids=()\n\n######################################################\n\n# Helper function to concatenate and format several bedtools output sequences \n# into a single, appropriately named contig\nconcatenate_helper() {\n    local input_bedtools_fastas=\"$1\"\n    local parent_ID=\"$2\"\n    local reference_name=\"\"\n    local positions=\"\"\n    local concatenated_sequences=\"\"\n\n    # Read the input line by line\n    while IFS= read -r line; do\n        # Check if the line starts with \"&gt;\"\n        if [[ \"$line\" == \"&gt;\"* ]]; then\n            # Extract reference name and position from the line\n            reference_position=\"${line:1}\"  # Remove \"&gt;\"\n            reference_name=$(echo \"$reference_position\" | cut -d: -f1)\n            position=$(echo \"$reference_position\" | cut -d: -f2)\n\n            # Append position to the positions variable\n            positions+=\"$position,\"\n        else\n            # Concatenate sequences\n            concatenated_sequences+=\"$line\"\n        fi\n    done &lt;&lt;&lt; \"$input_bedtools_fastas\"\n\n    # Remove trailing comma from positions\n    positions=\"${positions%,}\"\n\n    # Output the reformatted result\n    echo \"&gt;$parent_ID $reference_name:$positions\"\n    echo \"$concatenated_sequences\"\n}\n\n######################################################\n\n# Process your input bed file\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n\n    # pull the parent ID number for the current line of the bed\n    parentID=$(echo \"$line\" | grep -o 'Parent=Peve_[0-9]\\+')\n    \n    # Only continue if you haven't already processed the CDS sequences associated with this parent ID\n    if [[ ! \" ${processed_ids[@]} \" =~ \" $parentID \" ]]; then\n \n        # Add the current parentID to the processed list\n        processed_ids+=(\"$parentID\")\n\n        # Create temporary files to store intermediate results\n        temp_CDS_bed_file=$(mktemp)\n        temp_bedtools_fasta_file=$(mktemp)\n\n        # Grab all of the CDS sequences with the same parent ID and write to temporary file\n        grep \"$parentID\" ${transcriptome_bed} &gt; \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\"\n\n        # Use bedtools to extract corresponding FASTAs and write to temporary file\n        ${programs_array[bedtools]} getfasta -fi ${genome_fasta} -bed \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\" -fo \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\"\n\n        # Use our helper function to concatenate and format all of these CDS fastas into a single contig\n        concatenated_fasta=$(concatenate_helper \"$(cat \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\")\" \"$parentID\")\n \n        # Add the concatenated CDS fasta to our output file on a new line\n        echo \"$concatenated_fasta\" &gt;&gt; ${transcriptome_fasta}\n\n        # Remove the temporary files\n        rm \"$temp_CDS_bed_file\" \"$temp_bedtools_fasta_file\"\n    fi\ndone &lt; ${transcriptome_bed}\n\n# The output file ends up having a blank first line before the data, so delete that unwanted empty first line\nsed -i '1{/^$/d}' ${transcriptome_fasta}\n\nNow we have a transcriptome FASTA the can be used for kallisto abundance quantification!"

    "text": "I’m currently trying to quantify RNA abundances using RNAseq data from the three E5 deep dive species, and I’m running into some issues for P. evermanni.\nLinks:\n\ncode (.Rmd)\nknitted file (.md)\ngithub issue\n\nThere’s no published transcriptome fasta for P. evermanni, so instead I’m using a published CDS gff file and associated scaffold genome fasta to assemble a de novo reference transcriptome fasta.\nI first used bedtools getfasta to extract fasta sequences for everything listed in the original CDS gff file, but ended up with duplicate sequences, which interferes with kallisto indexing. While trying (and failing) to remove duplicates with the fastx_toolkit fastx_collapser, Steven pointed out that the gff file (image below) I’m using contains sequences labeled as both CDS and mRNA sequences, and suggested I use only those labeled as mRNA.\n\nI selected only sequecnes labelled as “mRNA” in the gff, extracted those sequences fastas from the scaffold reference, and was able to successfully build a kallisto index, however I was given a warning that kallisto index had identified 10,722,052 non-ACGUT characters in the 40,389 input sequences (or ~265 non-ACGUT characters per sequence!). Quickly looking through some of the extracted sequence fastas, I found some of them contain long internal stretches of N characters.\n\nSam was able to inform me that this is due to the reference fasta I’m using to extract mRNA fastas. The reference is a scaffold, which characteristically contains arbitrary stretches of Ns connecting known sequences to others in the same region. Steven then also noticed that the gff file seems to be improperly labeled, with mRNA sequences that actually contain several CDS regions and introns, which could interfere with pseudoalignment. Instead, of using the labelled mRNAs, I may need to extract all the sequences labelled as CDS from the gff, obtain sequences fastas, group and concatenate by “Parent” (source mRNA) to exclude all of the introns, and then use those concatenated CDS fasta sequences as a reference for kallisto.\nSome pseudo code for doing this:\nstart with original.gff, which contains CDS, mRNA, UTR, etc. sequences\ngrep -w \"CDS\" original.gff &gt; filtered.gff\nnow I have a filtered gff that only contains info for CDS sequences in a format that looks like:\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000001\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\nblahblahblahblahblahblahblah Parent=Peve_00000002\n…\nwhere each Parent ID (“Parent=Peve_00000001”) groups together CDS sequences that originate from the same mRNA. To get full concatenated fasta sequences for each mRNA I’ll do:\nfor i in #LinesInFiltered.gff:\n\n  get parentID of filtered.gff line i\n\n  if parentID not already in final.fasta:\n\n    extract all lines in filtered.gff with parentID\n    bedtools to get each lines' fasta sequence\n    concatenate all of these fastas\n    assign appropriate ID that includes parentID to concatenated fasta\n    add this parentID.fasta to final.fasta\nthis final.fasta should contain the same number of sequence fastas as unique parentIDs in filtered.gff"

How can you get useful/trustworthy information by comparing your data to itsself…?\n^in effort to make sense of above question I made a quick sketch – I think it’s something like this? I realized that I forgot (for the nth time) that I’m working with RNA now, not DNA, so there are multiple copies of every sequenced transcript, and for DGE work the relative abundances of the transcripts, rather than presence/absence, is what matters.\n\nFeeling very dumb and confused about the minutia of how to do the deep dive gene expression stuff so switched back to a generic DGE pipeline in preparation for the cod samples.

We have trimmed RNAseq reads for the three species but we couldn’t find any published transcriptomes. However, for P.meandrina we found NCBI published gff files with only annotated protein-coding genes, which could maybe be used to approximate a transcriptome file? We’re not sure if that work correctly with kallisto though, or if we’d still need to use HiSat…\nRead up on some of the sncRNA tools we used to write up on them in the deep dive manuscript (loving how it takes like 40min of reading to write 1 summary sentence of how something works)."

Triploid summer mortality is the big concern, so it would be useful to have some way to “diagnose” stress in the field, informing farms when/how they need to adjust their setups to avoid mass mortality (e.g., adding feed, moving bags to reduce density, shifting to cooler waters, bring into hatchery(?), etc.). Stress “priming” is also a way that hatcheries could preemptively prepare stock for stressful events. Maybe a cool tweak to the project would be to start with diploid/triploid larvae, prime some (but not others), raise to adulthood, and outplant to see how they do in the field. Throughout, measure some set of physiological features (e.g., respiration) to quantify stress and try to develop some assay of biomarkers indicative of stress/impending mortality. Could still do temp and nutrition stress\nI also really like the idea that Sarah suggested about making notebook posts for specific topics when I do a deep dive into the literature on a specific thing, plus her notebook has some really cool features, so I think I’m going to try to implement some of those!"

Probably doesn’t affect end result of kallisto much, since it’s pseudoaligning full reads, but still need to fix it. Should be a straightforward fix, the biggest pain will be waiting another 4 hours for the adjusted transcriptome generation code to run again😭\nDid a quick and dirty test using both a gff and a bed file as input to bedtools getfasta and both resulted in the same output, suggesting bedtools does appropriately differentiate between the formats! I’ll still convert to bed before generating the P.evermanni transcriptome though, just in case"

It ran much quicker this time around and resulted in a much smaller output file, which means one of the two times I ran the script something was wrong. I did some brief poking around in the two outputs and it looks like maybe the original run was accidentally done using the full gff file, instead of the CDS-only gff?

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq. I requested access through the indicated email and will ask about it during Friday Science Hour if I don’t hear back by then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several weeks of accumulating issues with running command line and working in RStudio/Github (both locally and on Raven), I think I’ve finally resolved them all! I was able to run the tutorial blast code successfully (I think). I still want to figure out/ask about the function of all the parameters called (e.g. -evalue 1E-20), and to figure out how to interpret the output results (or at least learn how to identify possible issues in the output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevelations from lab meeting today! Several of my Raven problems were solved during our raven/github-focused meeting today – notes below:\n\nConnecting Raven with my Github. I needed to enter\n```{bash} git config –global user.email \"[mygithubemailthatIdon'twanttopublicize]\"   git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"```\nand then log in to git using my username and a personal access token (which I have now created). I’m now fully connected to github from Raven and have successfully pushed/pulled!\nGetting/accessing ncbi blast software on Raven. Blast is indeed already downloaded and accessible on Raven, it’s just in a higher-level directory that I couldn’t find because I didn’t know about it (I can only default view my home directory on Raven). The higher-level lab directory is /home/shared, and ncbi-blast v. 2.12.0 is already installed there!\nPushing large files to Github. Don’t! Any file (e.g. output file) sizes larger than 100MB should not be pushed to Github - instead, put it on Gannet (another lab server intended for large-file-size data and output storage). Already github-issued Sam/Steven to ask for access to Gannet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter fairly continuous head-bashing (pun intended ;) ) with RStudio/bash/blast for the last two weeks I’m kind of tired of it, so today I’m going to focus on other stuff – like setting some goals! I’ve had ~3 weeks now to get settled into the lab and Steven and I have had the chance to talk about possible directions for the near future, so let’s put some stuff in writing – see October Goals post for details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI continued trying to figure out how to work in Raven today and ran into another fun problem – my Raven RStudio isn’t connected to my github, even though I copied the directory I’m working in directly from Github in the same way I would copy a repo to RStudio on my local machine. I realized I wasn’t able to commit or push/pull, and using the command ```{bash} git config –global user.name \"shedurkin\"``` didn’t fix the issue. It clearly isn’t an issue with my shell script/terminal because I’ve been successfully running command line code on Raven. Maybe Raven isn’t supposed to end up tied to github? I would think the code and stuff should all end up on github for backup/reproducibility purposes, but I can also see why sending some things to github (e.g. output files) could require an unreasonable amount of storage…\nI also managed to modify the 001-blast.Rmd tutorial script to download a windows version of ncbi blast to Raven and run the .exe, but I wasn’t able to successfully access the blast.exe component used in the first task of the tutorial file (setting blast directory). Neither I nor google can figure out why with a cursory search and I unfortunately have class soon, but in the worst case I can bring this up at lab meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam was able to resend me login credentials for Raven (the Lab’s primary server, implemented through a browser version of RStudio), so I started getting situated on it. Since I have a pending task related to blasting a cod transcriptome, I copied over my github repo RobertsLab_OnboardingTasks and took another look at the blast tutorial .Rmd file (001-blast.Rmd). The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finished the cod temp/growth analysis assigned by Steven\n\n\n\nI’m still having issues with the disconnect between which shell script is being used by my terminal and which is used by console in R. We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I may have fixed the issue running bash code chunks in Rmd files! Included the following:\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path=list(bash='C:/Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe'))\n\nAnd now, while I still don’t seem to get any output when I try to run individual code chunks by pressing the “play” button in the top right corner, knitting the document works! I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it. Will ask about it during Science Hour tomorrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started looking at the github tasks Steven assigned me to familiarize me with Raven and the lab’s computing practices (analyzing some weight/temp data and BLASTing/annotating a transcriptome), but quickly ran into setup issues. I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted an additional employee training and went over my lit review questions (see Oct.5 entry) with Steven. Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\n\nA: check supplemental\n\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\n\nA: Regions are just more broad than genes (so regions could contain genes). The scale (in terms of number of bp) goes loci -&gt; genes -&gt; regions.\n\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\n\nA: each cell represents gene and the z-score is basically showing a heatmap of gene expression. The “tree” looking thing is just showing clustering of individuals based on expression level.\n\nor figure 5\n\nA: Steven is also kind of confused about this rn, but check supplementals for more\n\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nDEG=Differentially expressed gene (rather than differentially methylated), and yes, CpGs are cytosine/guanine pairs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinued reading through recent lab publications (see entry from yesterday) and compiled some questions about them to ask Steven at Science Hour tomorrow (see below). I also completed the required HazCom training (and returned updated training documentation to Sam), requested access to the UW chemical inventory/safety system, and wrote and uploaded a personal description, lab notebook link, email, and picture, to the lab website.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable?

I was also able to log in to my new Gannet account and get it set up, so I should (theoretically) be able to store large files there now. I’m still not 100 sure how I would do that though. I’ve read through some old Github issues and stuff and I think I’d need to either ssh or rsync to connect to Gannet from Raven and then copy over the large files using that connection. I’m not not familiar with rsync, so I’m not sure what the difference between ssh and rsync is or which is preferable. I also am not 100% sure what the server host name/IP address would be to ssh into Gannet, but I’m guessing I can use the IP that Gannet emailed to me. Since I’m not confident in correctly connecting and copying to Gannet from Raven I haven’t uploaded the blast/annotation output files or pushed anything from running the rmd to github. I’ll either ask about it in lab tomorrow or Science Hour on Friday.\nI’m also still not sure what a lot of the code from Steven’s blast/annotation code is doing, so I want to do a deep-dive into the commands being run.\nLastly, I finally took a moment to try registering for SICB only to find out I don’t have access to the College of Environment purchasing system, Treq.

We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post)."

    "text": "I’ve continued trying to troubleshoot my issues with running bash code chunks in .Rmd files. Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful."

I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow."

    "text": "Completed an additional employee training and went over my lit review questions (see Oct.5 entry) with Steven. Also github-issued Sam about getting added to Raven.\nQuestions:\nGeneral\n\nI read that both cytosine and adenine can be methylated, but every paper I’ve read so far studying methylation only looked at methylation of cytosine – is there a reason adenine methylation is not commonly studied?\n\nA: adenine is only methylated in certain taxa (e.g. bacteria), and isn’t methylated in marine inverts\n\nIs all methylation (in gamete cells) heritable/potentially heritable? Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\n\nA: Since polyploidy reduces breeding potential so could be useful in conservation. But don;t have any information on relationship between polyploidy and methylation or the mechanisms of how polyploidy affects methylation\n\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\n\nA:\n\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nA: Don’t want to go overboard and kill all the oysters, so start out trying with less stressful stress conditions. Want to understand more than just the death outcome.\n\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\n\nA: doesn’t know, maybe check supplemental materials or ask in Slack\n\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\n\nA: Not assumed, but it wasn’t measured. Emma Tidman paper looks at effect of acidification on various measures of shell strength/size.\nA: Emma also looked at body mass/tissue impacts of acidification (but yes, there is generally a correlation between shell size and body mass)\n\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\n\nA: check supplemental\n\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\n\nA: Regions are just more broad than genes (so regions could contain genes). The scale (in terms of number of bp) goes loci -&gt; genes -&gt; regions.\n\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\n\nA: each cell represents gene and the z-score is basically showing a heatmap of gene expression. The “tree” looking thing is just showing clustering of individuals based on expression level.\n\nor figure 5\n\nA: Steven is also kind of confused about this rn, but check supplementals for more\n\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nDEG=Differentially expressed gene (rather than differentially methylated), and yes, CpGs are cytosine/guanine pairs"

Is it even necessary?\nSo Zhu et al. 2022 found symbiont-associated miRNAs in coral transcriptome, but also mentioned in intro that (in other studies) foreign miRNA presence was correlated with intake (e.g. when human ate certain plant associated miRNAs present in human serum, but would disappear if they stopped eating that plant). Does that mean that presence/function of symbiont miRNAs in corals change when the coral is bleached (aka, the symbionts are gone)?

I’ve only taken a basic molgen class though, which didn’t go very in-depth in to how RNAs (especially ncRNAs) work, so this may be a basic knowledge gap. In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary?

I backed up all my work to Gannet, then undid all my local commits, and recommitted/pushed only the .gitignore file. Once it was pushed, I reran my code to generate all the outputs again, and was able to successfully commit and push.

If some symbiont miRNAs may be affecting coral immune response, could this play into coral immunocompromisation during bleaching?\nHas there been any similar work with other taxa of Symbiodiniaceae?\n\nTrigg et al. 2021\nAlso, not from either of the papers, but I was kind of confused about Sam’s discussion of trying different trimming sizes to ID miRNAs. I’ve only taken a basic molgen class though, which didn’t go very in-depth in to how RNAs (especially ncRNAs) work, so this may be a basic knowledge gap. In contrast to DNA, where all of the different introns/exons, etc. are contained in one long strand of DNA, I thought transcribed RNAs were separate molecules. If that’s the case my understanding on how we sequence miRNAs is that we isolate all the RNAs of a very small size (20-30bp) and then sequence them – why, then, would trimming (beyond removing the adapters that facilitate enrichment) be necessary? And how do you decide to do trimming? Do all miRNAs have some identical feature that indicates the beginning/end of them (like start/stop codons in DNA)?"

This feels basic, but considering the myriad difficulties I’ve had with RStudio/Github/Raven/bash/blast over the last few weeks, something tells me it won’t be :/\nRead up on the cod temperature/growth project. I’m going to be sticking with this project for a while, so I want to get a better background understanding of project goals, methodology, and data collection/processing to-date. I’m really excited to be working on an experimental project, since my previous work has all used broad survey data from various sample collection trips and museum collections! This project may also involve more wetwork, which I’d be really excited to get my hands on – as much as I love coding, I’m already missing the lab a bit.\nRead up on E5 coral project and start to get settled in it. I’m also going to be joining the E5 coral project – returning to my coral background! (Technically my background is in soft corals not stony, but details details details). I’ve already looked through the E5 coral website a few times, but I want to do a deeper dive once I know exactly what aspect of the project I’m going to be working on (maybe short RNAs?)\nGet registered for SICB.

The project will definitely be changing a bit from what I wrote, but I really appreciated the first step. I’ve taken the cod RNAseq data through all the basic DGE analysis using DESeq2. Now I need to tackle the GO analysis and look into using WGCNA to examine coexpression. I have probably half of a preliminary methods section of the cod manuscript done. I haven’t made a planning doc for the oyster experiment, largely because I’ve still been feeling very unclear on how exactly the project implementation is going to work. Hopefully I’ll be able to resolve that this month. Finally, I was able to meet with Laura about the cod project!

In this step, kallisto takes your reference transcriptome as input and breaks each transcript into “k-mers,” or shorter sequences that are k nucleotides long. It then “indexes” these k-mers, storing each k-mer and its transcript association in a data structure for more efficient retrieval during the pseudoalignment step.\n\n\nSample quantification\nNext is quantification, which take both the index you just constructed and your trimmed RNAseq read, and makes use of pseudoalignment, a process that is much faster and more efficient than aligning each full read to a full transcript. Briefly, each read is broken up into k-mers, which are then mapped to the index to see which indexed transcript k-mers may match the read k-mers. Kallisto then calculates a probability score for each read/transcript pair, evaluating the likelihood that a given read originated from each transcript. These scores are then used to estimate transcript abundance.\n\n\nBuild count matrix for all samples\nThe kallisto quantification process can only take one sample (i.e., one pair of reads) at a time, so as a last step we build a counts matrix that lists the transcript abundances for all of our samples in a single file.\n\n\nSummary\nA. pulchra:\nsample 140 – 47M reads processed (61.4% mapped)\nsample 145 – 42M reads processed (65.3% mapped)\nsample 150 – 43M reads processed (47.0% mapped)\nsample 173 – 47M reads processed (60.7% mapped)\nsample 178 – 42M reads processed (59.3% mapped)\n\nP. evermanni:\nsample 71 – 50M reads processed (35.3% mapped)\nsample 73 – 51M reads processed (29.8% mapped)\nsample 76 – 49M reads processed (35.6% mapped)\nsample 79 – 49M reads processed (31.9% mapped)\nsample 82 – 48M reads processed (37.3% mapped)\nP. meandrina:\nsample 47 – 54M reads processed (26.1% mapped)\nsample 48 – 51M reads processed (25.3% mapped)\nsample 50 – 55M reads processed (31.1% mapped)\nsample 53 – 53M reads processed (31.8% mapped)\nsample 57 – 42M reads processed (21.7% mapped)"

I liked a lot of things about the narration itself. Some of the voice options were very human-like and easy to listen to, and it did a pretty good (though not perfect) job of pronouncing uncommon jargon. On the other hand, I disliked several aspects of how it displays the content you’ve uploaded while it’s narrating it. Upon uploading a pdf, all of the text is extracted and displayed in a sectioned viewing pane that is completely removed from the original pdf (see below). That means that, in order to refer to figures or find “where” what you’re listening to is in the original document , you have to navigate to a completely separate pane to view the original pdf. Audemic also doesn’t track in-text where the reader is at that time, so it’s very difficult to find where you are in the text. Finally, there are a couple annoying things, like buggy Zotero uploading and being unable to switch “voice” without re-uploading the document.\nOverall, given the many features I find annoying and the still-high price tag, I’m not sure Audemic is worth the money, but it is the most human-like option I’ve found so far."

Objectively though, it does seem like a decent option.\nThe real strengths of Voice Dream seem to lie in its customizable text navigation features. For example, you can choose your forward and backward “skip” buttons to skip by different time intervals, by paragraph, by heading, etc. You can set a timer for how long the narration will read, and can change a variety of visual settings (font, spacing, background color, etc.). When reading you can choose to view the text in either a plain text viewing pane or in the original document and both options support an in-text speech cursor to show where the narration is.\nHowever, several of the boasted features fell flat to me. While there are a ton of voices to choose from, all of the ones I tried are much more synth-sounding than Audemic, in both tone and inflection. Pronunciation of jargon is also not as good as Audemic, though there does seem to be a feature for correcting pronunciation of individual words. As in Audemic, your voice selection is document-specific, so you have to re-select the voice you want every time. While the website claims Voice Dream skips citations and superfluous text, when I uploaded a pdf and tried listening it didn’t skip either of these. It also didn’t identify sections for my uploaded pdf (e.g. Abstract, Intro, etc.), so I couldn’t use the section navigation option. On top of these disappointing features, some features are missing entirely. Voice Dream has no web app, so you can’t listen from a PC or Android, and there’s no option to import directly from Zotero or PaperPile, meaning manual upload is required.\nUltimately I know the quality of the voice is going to be much more important for my retention than text navigation features, so I don’t think Voice Dream is a good option for me. The voices are just too robotic, especially in comparison with Audemic."

It’s very expensive, and the price was increased in the last month from an already high $120/yr to a staggering $140/yr. After trying it out, though, I think this may be my favorite option!\nSpeechify has all of the standard text navigation/viewing options (in-text tracker, can view original document or transcribed reading pane with viewing features, adjustable reading speed, skip citations+, etc.), but there are two features that really stand out to me. The first is that a lot of the voices are very lifelike and easy for me to listen to, which is really important to me. The second is their ambient sound option, which allows you to play background sound (e.g. music on Spotify, white noise) at an automatically lowered volume while the app narrates text on top. This is super cool for me! I’ve been looking for something like this for a really long time, because when I work out I want to play music with a suitable beat, but I also want to listen to audiobooks or something because I get bored quickly – that’s exactly what this feature does! The last cool feature that also deserves a mention is Speechify’s AI integration. You can generate AI summaries of any document, and you can ask questions to chatGPT in the speechify app and then listen to the responses.\nMost of my annoyances with Speechify are pretty minor. Like most of the other options, Speechify doesn’t have a way to upload documents directly from Zotero (or any other reference manager), which makes the process more tedious. There’s also no feature to separate text into navigable sections (e.g. Intro, Methods), and you can’t annotate in-app, so you’d need to switch to a different tool to make notes, highlight, etc."

    "text": "While writing some script to generate a transcriptome fasta using a CDS gff and scaffold genome, I ran into the question of how exactly the bedtools getfasta tool handles gff and bed file inputs. While both gff and bed files list basically the same types of sequence information, they list the genomic coordinates of the sequences slightly differently. gff files use a 1-based system, while bed files use a 0-based system (for details on how those differ, see this website post that I found helpful!). Bedtools states in the documentation for it’s getfasta function that gff files are accepted as input, but it isn’t made clear whether bedtools will treat the genomic coordinates in a gff file as 1-based, or as the o-based system used in bedtool’s more standard file format, bed.\nTo test whether bedtools can appropriately identify and parse both gff and bed files, I wrote some quick test files to run through bedtools getfasta.\nWrite the test files:\n\n\necho -e \"&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\" &gt; test_input.fasta\necho -e \"AAAGGGTTTCCCAAAGGGTTTCCC\" &gt;&gt; test_input.fasta\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t1\\t5\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t11\\t15\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t20\\t20\\t.\\t-\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.gff\n\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t0\\t5\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t10\\t15\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000001\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\necho -e \"Porites_evermani_scaffold_1\\t19\\t20\\t.\\t.\\t-\\tGmove\\tCDS\\t.\\tParent=Peve_00000002\" &gt;&gt; test_input.bed\n\nexport PATH=/home/shared/bedops_linux_x86_64-v2.4.41/bin:$PATH\n\n${bedops}/gff2bed --do-not-sort &lt; test_input.gff &gt; test_input_gfftobed.bed\n\nRun through bedtools getfasta:\n\nsource .bashvars\ncd ~/deep-dive/E-Peve/data\n\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.gff -fo test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input.bed -fo test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n${bedtools} getfasta -fi test_input.fasta -bed test_input_gfftobed.bed -fo test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nhead test_gff_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_bed_to_fasta.fasta\necho \"\"\nhead test_gff_to_bed_to_fasta.fasta\n\nOutput:\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T  \n\n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:0-5 AAAGG \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:10-15 CCAAA \n&gt;Porites_evermani_scaffold_1:19-20 T\nAll three files resulted in identical FASTA outputs !

(I think this is super cool!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: note\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nwarning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nimportant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip with Title\n\n\n\ntip\n(This is an example of a callout with a title)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand To Learn About Collapse\n\n\n\n\n\nand caution\nThis is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n\n\n\nYou can also adjust the appearance of callouts in your doc\n\n\nCode annotation\nYou can insert footnote-like in-code anotations. This seems potentially redundant if you have good commenting in your code but it could still help make code explanations more digestible. You can also adjust how the annotation will appear using the code-annotations: command in the document YAML.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n1penguins |&gt;\n2  mutate(\n    bill_ratio = bill_depth_mm / bill_length_mm,\n    bill_area  = bill_depth_mm * bill_length_mm\n  )\n\n1\n\nTake penguins, and then,\n\n2\n\nadd new columns for the bill ratio and bill area.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor tools\nThere are a whooooolllllleeee bunch of different options for specifying different author/article information that’s normally included in scientific publications (authors, affiliations, corresponding, copyright, orcid ID, abstract, keywords, etc.).

    "text": "We (Eric, Grace L., Ariana, and I) spent the day at the Point Whitney research station, performing a reciprocal heat stress treatment and sampling on 4 Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) life stages (spat, seed, juvenile, adult) for Eric’s thesis work. See previous post for materials and Ariana’s post for project details.\nOrganism: Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)\nLifestages: Seed, Spat, Juvenile, Adult\nFor each of the four life stages, Eric had already performed an original conditioning treatment. We an additiol reciprocal exposure to acute stress. For example, half of the spat “control” group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, half of the “control” group was left in ambient temperature, half of the “treated” spat group was exposed to the 32*C “high” stress, and half of the “treated” spat group was left in ambient.\nConditioning treatment groups: Control, Treated\nAcute stress treatment groups: Ambient, High (32*C)\nPossible treatment group combinations: Control/Ambient, Control/High, Treated/Ambient, Treated/High\nFor each age class, each set of treatment conditions was sampled. Sampling was performed slightly differently for each age, due to size restrictions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge class\nSampling approach (for each of the 4 treatment combinations)\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Whole animals were preserved, since the spat are too small to easily extract tissue from the shell.\n\n\nSeed\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Seed are larger than spat, so we were able to crack open the shell of each animal and preserve the whole animal tissue.\n\n\nJuvenile\nOverview: 17 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=6, DNA n=6, frozen n=5) from 17 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 6 animals for RNA preservation, 6 animals for DNA preservation, and 5 animals to be flash frozen (e.g., for lipid work). Juveniles are large enough to open the shell and differentiate between tissue types, but too small to split gill tissue into multiple samples, so the entire gill tissue of each animal was sampled.\n\n\nAdult\nOverview: 24 samples per treatment combination (RNA n=8, DNA n=8, frozen n=8) from 8 animals\nFor each treatment set, sampled 8 animals total. From each animal, gill tissue was extracted and separated into three portions, which were preserved for RNA, DNA, and flash frozen. This means we have “sets” of samples for the adults (e.g. a sample preserved for RNA work is associated with a sample preserved for DNA and a sample that was flash frozen, since all three are from the same animal), with a total of 24 samples for each treatment combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl/Ambient\nControl/High\nTreated/Ambient\nTreated/High\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nSpat\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nSeed\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nJuvenile\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 6\nDNA: 6\nfrozen: 5\nRNA: 24\nDNA: 24\nfrozen: 20\n68 total\n\n\nAdult\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 8\nDNA: 8\nfrozen: 8\nRNA: 32\nDNA: 32\nfrozen: 32\n96 total\n\n\nTotal\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 26\nDNA: 26\nfrozen: 23\n75 total\nRNA: 104\nDNA: 104\nfrozen: 92\n300 total samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe oysters (each age class and treatment group in individual tubes or bags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA juvenile oyster during sampling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOysters post-sampling"
