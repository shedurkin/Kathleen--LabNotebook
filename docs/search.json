I’ve had ~3 weeks now to get settled into the lab and Steven and I have had the chance to talk about possible directions for the near future, so let’s put some stuff in writing :)\n\nSuccessfully run a blast search in Raven. This feels basic, but considering the myriad difficulties I’ve had with RStudio/Github/Raven/bash/blast over the last few weeks, something tells me it won’t be :/\nRead up on the cod temperature/growth project. I’m going to be sticking with this project for a while, so I want to get a better background understanding of project goals, methodology, and data collection/processing to-date. I’m really excited to be working on an experimental project, since my previous work has all used broad survey data from various sample collection trips and museum collections! This project may also involve more wetwork, which I’d be really excited to get my hands on – as much as I love coding, I’m already missing the lab a bit.\nRead up on E5 coral project and start to get settled in it. I’m also going to be joining the E5 coral project – returning to my coral background! (Technically my background is in soft corals not stony, but details details details). I’ve already looked through the E5 coral website a few times, but I want to do a deeper dive once I know exactly what aspect of the project I’m going to be working on (maybe short RNAs?)"

    "text": "Sam was able to resend me login credentials for Raven (the Lab’s primary server, implemented through a browser version of RStudio), so I started getting situated on it. Since I have a pending task related to blasting a cod transcriptome, I copied over my github repo RobertsLab_OnboardingTasks and took another look at the blast tutorial .Rmd file (001-blast.Rmd). The last time I tried to run this tutorial file (on RStudio locally) I ran into problems running bash through RStudio at all.\nThankfully that isn’t an issue working in Raven, but now I’m kind of stumped because of the need to download and run blast. I can’t find any “higher level” directories above my own Raven account that might hold relevant software like ncbi-blast, but it seems weird that I’d need to individually download the software for use on a shared server…The code included in the tutorial file for this also wouldn’t work on my machine, since it’s written with Mac-specific and outdated versions of blast. I downloaded the most recent Windows version of blast to my local machine, but I don’t think I can access local software from Raven since it’s a server."

I still haven’t figured out how to permanently set the default shell script for running bash code chunks from Rmd files (checking default shell using “Sys.which(”bash”)” from the console still returns “C::\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe” aka WSL), so for now I guess I’ll just have to include that YAML block in any Rmd file I’m working in.\nStarted working on cod temp/size data analysis assigned by Steven but haven’t been able to push to the lab Github repo (project-cod-temperature) bc, while I successfully cloned the repo to RStudio, I haven’t been able to connect them so I’m able to push changes back to it.

I made a new github repo using the lab’s project template and tried running through one of the blast tutorials included in the project template, but immediately had problems with running the bash code chunks. I’ve done command-line data analysis work before, but never through an Rmarkdown file or in RStudio. When I tried to run any of the bash code chunks nothing would happen, not even an error output. First I updated Windows and RStudio, since I had updates waiting for both of them, but that didn’t help. Since I work on a Windows laptop, which doesn’t have a default way to run shell scripts, I downloaded and normally use the software Cygwin – I think the problem running bash code in Rstudio may stem from RStudio not having a way to run bash, aka not having it’s path to run bash script directing to Cygwin? I’ll try more troubleshooting tomorrow."

Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated? One scenario I can think of is intentional hybridization of two species to selectively breed a more resilient population – since polyploidy is more common in hybrids, may be important to understand its impacts. I also know polyploidy sometimes happens in corals (especially Caribbean corals), which can reproduce asexually fairly easily. (Need to read related paper Stephens et al. 2023 – w/ Putnam and Bhattacharya!)\nConfused about a couple aspects of the experimental setup:\n\nStated that lab obtained 500 oysters for the experiment, but then states that the starting sample size of each of the six treatments (2 controls, 2 single stressor, 2 multiple stressors) was 112, which adds to way over 500 oysters\nFor the multiple stressors treatment, why was aerial exposure not repeated multiple times (since low tide happens on a regular daily schedule, not just once during a given warming event)?\n\nIn Results, why is survival probability not the direct inverse of mortality?\nI think I noticed some typos… do you want to know about them or just leave it be?\n\nPutnam et al. 2023 (Dynamic DNA methylation contributes to carryover effects…)\n\nIn the results section I saw that shell area was used as a proxy for shell size – is it assumed that shell thickness remains fairly constant? Do we know this will hold during acidification? Also, are shell size and body mass tightly correlated? (I would assume so, but it would be interesting if acidic conditions messed with that relationship)\nIn Fig.3 I’m a little confused about the y-axes of 3c and 3d – what is the baseline (the “1”) for these relative size values? It doesn’t seem like it could be original size (as in a and b)\nWhat is the difference between differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs)? Are DMRs just methylation of non-coding DNA (e.g. introns)?\nI have no idea what’s going on in figure 4 :(\nor figure 5\nWhat are DEGs (pg12)? Also, are CpGs just cytosine/guanine pairs?\n\nGeneral interests:\nUnderstanding and mitigating impacts of climate change/anthropogenic disturbance on marine ecosytems\nSpecific interests:\nepigenetics (and heritbility of epigenetic modifications), phenotypic plasticity, microbiome, disease resistance/resilience, ecotoxicology\nAdditional papers to read:\nEirin-Lopez and Putnam, 2019 (shows DNA methylation varies in response to environmental factors in marine inverts)\nStephens et al. 2023 (Ploidy variation and its implications for reproduction and population dynamics in two sympatric coral species)\nStrader et al. 2019 (heritable epigenetic modifications and transgenerational plasticity in sea urchins)"

Do we know? If not, do we know why/what determines heritability? What about other forms of epigenetic modification?\n\nSimilarly, what proportion of methylation (or epigenetic modification in general) affects gamete cells?\nA: Differs among taxa. We have secondary evidence that it is in marine inverts. For taxa where there’s more evidence, modification has to happen during early developmental stages of gonads (presumably to alter the gamete cells). A lot of it is unknown though (similar for other forms of modification e.g. histone modification)\n\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 (Triploid Pacific oysters exhibit stress response dysregulation…)\n\nGeorge et al. 2023 studied polyploidy in oysters because of its common use in oyster aquaculture – does polyploidy have any potential conservation applications, particularly in eukaryotes, for whom ployploidy is often better tolerated?

Running Sys.which(“bash”) in the RStudio console the path “C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\SYSTEM32\\\\bash.exe”, which I think is bash installed as a part of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I have WSL installed and I’ve tried opening and running commands in the WSL bash, but it crashes every time I open it, before I have the chance to try any commands. Maybe there’s something wrong with it which is why bash chunks won’t run in RStudio? I’m not 100% convinced because, weirdly enough, the terminal in my RStudio is functional – I can run command line code from it (e.g. “pwd”) from it with correct outputs. Running “which bash” from RStudio’s terminal returns the path, “/usr/bin/bash”. I have no idea why the terminal would be functional for running command line but bash code chunks inside an Rmd file aren’t.\nOk I checked which shell my RStudio Terminal was using (Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Terminal &gt; New terminals open with) and my Terminal was using Git Bash. When I changed it to open using WSL Bash and tried to open a new terminal, the new terminal opened briefly and then immediately crashed and closed, just like when I tried opening WSL bash on my machine. Switching back to Git Bash and opening a new terminal with it worked just fine, which means the problem running bash code chunks in Rmd files must be because (for some reason) the bash code chunks in Rmd files are being run using the (apparently nonfunctional) WSL bash, instead of Git Bash! I need to figure out how to change the path so that bash code chunks will run with Git Bash – I honestly have no idea how to do this though… I would normally assume that setting a preferred shell script for terminal would also set the script for running bash code chunks. The disconnect between terminal and shell script used by console also suggests I won’t be able to change the console path to bash from the terminal so….. I’m stumped. Googling the issue is not helpful."

We realized today that my problems pushing my analysis code to the lab’s project-cod-temperature repo on github were related to the disconnect problem. I was able to pull and push to github when I was working within the repo on RStudio, but I couldn’t commit using the Git environment in the upper right pane. However, pushing, pulling, and committing manually from the terminal all worked fine. We think that, somehow, the commit action in the Git environment is using the same faulty WSL shell that my console is defaulting to, even though the push/pull actions are correctly defaulting to Git Bash. To make matters even more confusing, when I’m working within my lab notebook repo in RStudio I’m able to push, pull, and commit successfully from the Git environment with no issues. Why is my default shell script for console/some parts of git different between repos/RStudio projects?\nNo answers yet, but for right now I’m still able to maintain functionality while working locally because the terminal is functioning appropriately and I have a workaround to run bash code chunks included in Rmd files (see Oct.12 post)."
